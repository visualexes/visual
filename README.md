## 🛡️ Safety & Security

Security is our top priority. We utilize a custom "taint-check" bypass to prevent abnormal packet detection. While no tool is 100% risk-free, our dedicated **visual executor discord** community constantly monitors ban waves to keep you informed.

*   **Taint-Check Bypass**: Minimizes the risk of account flagging.
*   **Remote Kill-Switch**: If a detection is found, we disable the tool remotely to protect users.
